Web-Crawler
===========

A very simple Web Crawler.

This script does not utilize the advantages of multithreading or delve as deep into web crawling as Scrapy. It is meant only to demonstrate coding skills and programming style.

Run:
python webcrawler.py <URL> [max_no_of_URLs]
The last parameter is optional.
